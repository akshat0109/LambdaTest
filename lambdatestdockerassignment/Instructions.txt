Hi Shahid,
Thanks for giving me more time to try once againI have tried to complete the assignment to dockerize it and it's workingÂ fine.
Steps : 
Please update following details on path : lambdatestdockerassignment/chromexecutiondocker/dockerchromeexecution.py
					  lambdatestdockerassignment/firefoxexecutiondocker/dockerfirefoxexecution.py
					 															
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = ''
AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID = ''
AWS_BUCKET = ''

Please use command "sudo bash run.sh" to run the module present at path lambdatestdockerassignment/.

It will then ask for url input, Please provide and then press enter the code will auto run and will provide you output after complete execution
